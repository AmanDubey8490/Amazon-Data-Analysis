📌 Project Description — Amazon E-Commerce SQL Analysis

This project analyzes how Amazon manages its e-commerce operations using structured SQL data. It uses a realistic database model containing customers, products, orders, order items, discounts, payments, and returns to simulate Amazon’s transactional ecosystem. By applying SQL queries to this dataset, the project measures core business metrics such as gross sales, net revenue, average order value, profit margins, discount impact, and return losses.

Time-series analysis highlights month-wise performance trends and evaluates how major campaigns like festive sales affect revenue and profit. Customer and product insights identify top-selling items, repeat purchase behavior, and discount sensitivity. The findings reveal the operational strengths and weaknesses of the business model and provide practical improvements around pricing, discount planning, marketing efficiency, and profitability optimization.

Overall, the project demonstrates how SQL acts as a powerful tool for interpreting real e-commerce data and converting raw transactions into actionable business decisions.
